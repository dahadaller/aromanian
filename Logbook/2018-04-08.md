Installed react, babel and webpack according to the instructions on these 5 pages:



* [React Setup, Part I: React and ReactDOM | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i)
* [React Setup, Part II: Babel | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-ii)
* [React Setup, Part III: Webpack | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-iii)

```
Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialised using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
 - configuration.module has an unknown property 'loaders'. These properties are valid:
   object { exprContextCritical?, exprContextRecursive?, exprContextRegExp?, exprContextRequest?, noParse?, rules?, defaultRules?, unknownContextCritical?, unknownContextRecursive?, unknownContextRegExp?, unknownContextRequest?, unsafeCache?, wrappedContextCritical?, wrappedContextRecursive?, wrappedContextRegExp?, strictExportPresence?, strictThisContextOnImports? }
   -> Options affecting the normal modules (`NormalModuleFactory`).
```



so I kept getting the error above and I changed the following portion of webpack.config.js as spelled out in the codecademy article:

```javascript
module: {
    loaders: [
        {
            test: /\.js$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            loader: 'babel-loader'
        }
    ]
},
```

to this one that I found on stackexchange.

```javascript
module: {
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.js$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            loader: ['babel-loader']
        }
    ]
},
```

I don't know why it was fixed, but suddenly it was built.
